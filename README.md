## App Requirements
- **8 x 8 grid** in the screen center
- **Labels** on the vertical and horizontal axis
- **Overlay the chess pieces** as shown in the image
    - Download chess pieces from [here](https://opengameart.org/sites/default/files/chess.zip)
- **2 buttons** below the grid:
    1. **Random**: Chooses a random opening move and updates the board.
    2. **Reset**: Puts pieces back in their original state.

## Solution
1. Single screen application with a chess board and two buttons: 'Random' and 'Reset'.
2. Studied [Chess.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chess.js) to learn about rendering a chess board (following DRY principle).
3. Installed Chess.js from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chess.js).
4. Worked with **SEN**, **PGN**, and built-in methods provided by Chess.js to manipulate the chess board.
5. Used the following chess openings: `['1.e4', '1.d4', '1.Nf3', '1.c4', '1.g3']`.
6. Used `Chess.DEFAULT_POSITION` SEN string to reset the chess board.
